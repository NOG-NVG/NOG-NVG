### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Rock in DEISI

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Rock in DEISI project! This project aims to read and process files containing information about songs, artists, and song details. The goal is to extract the relevant lines with correct input, organize the data, and display it based on user queries. The project also focuses on optimizing the file reading process using efficient algorithms and includes a comprehensive suite of JUnit tests to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the code.

Jogo das Tendas

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to Jogo das Tendas, a challenging and entertaining game developed in Kotlin. In this game, players are presented with a grid containing trees and must strategically place tents to satisfy the given conditions. The objective is to place the correct number of tents near each tree while adhering to specific rules. Jogo das Tendas showcases my proficiency in Kotlin programming and problem-solving skills. Get ready for an exciting puzzle-solving adventure!

Prgramming Language: Kotlin

Features:
Intuitive user interface
Visual feedback
Read and process files containing game data for multiple styles
Implement various game difficulties to challenge players of different skill levels
Perform age verification checks to ensure appropriate gameplay
Provide an engaging and interactive gaming experience
Handle the reading and processing of external files
Enforce input validation to reject incorrect or invalid entries
 
For the time being, the project is complete, and I view it as something I'll likely go back in the future since I know I can make it better still, and I'm certain that by the time I examine it again, I'll have discovered new techniquesÂ and methods for improving.


Painters' Intervals


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Painters' Intervals program is designed to analyze a group of painters' intervals, specifically identifying overlapping or included intervals of different parts of a painting. This program is implemented in C and provides insights into the relationships between various sections of the painting.

Project Details 

Prgramming Language: C

Features:
Overlap Verification
Inclusion Verification
Input Processing
Counting
Output Display

Features:
Overlap Verification: The program checks if there are any overlapping intervals among the sections of the painting.
Inclusion Verification: It determines whether certain intervals are included within others.
Input Processing: The program reads and processes the intervals provided by the user.
Counting: It keeps track of the total number of intervals, intervals included, and intervals overlapped.
Output Display: The program presents the results, including the number of intervals included, the number of intervals overlapped, and the total number of cases analyzed.






Project: Unknown Project (C)
Additionally, I will be starting a new project in C as part of my final evaluation in my class. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting project!

Thank you for your interest in my projects. Happy coding!
