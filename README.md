### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Rock in DEISI
Welcome to the Rock in DEISI project! This project aims to read and process files containing information about songs, artists, and song details. The goal is to extract the relevant lines with correct input, organize the data, and display it based on user queries. The project also focuses on optimizing the file reading process using efficient algorithms and includes a comprehensive suite of JUnit tests to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the code.

Project Details
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Kotlin, C
Testing Framework: JUnit
Features
Read and process files containing song data
Extract lines with correct input and discard invalid entries
Organize and store the data for easy retrieval
Provide user interface for querying and displaying song information
Optimize file reading process for improved performance
Comprehensive JUnit test suite to ensure code reliability
Current Focus
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on optimizing the file reading process and improving the efficiency of data retrieval and storage.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new techniques and algorithms to enhance the performance of the Rock in DEISI project.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with optimizing the data organization and retrieval methods, as well as finding innovative ways to enhance the user interface.

ðŸ“« You can reach me by [email address] or connect with me on [social media handles].

Feel free to explore the project and contribute to its development. Your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are highly appreciated!

Project: Jogo das Tendas (Tents Game)
I have also developed a game called Jogo das Tendas in Kotlin language. This game offers a challenging and entertaining experience where players solve puzzles by placing tents in a grid. The objective is to satisfy the given conditions and place the correct number of tents near each tree. The Jogo das Tendas project showcases my proficiency in Kotlin programming and problem-solving skills.

Project: Unknown Project (C)
Additionally, I will be starting a new project in C as part of my final evaluation in my class. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting project!

Thank you for your interest in my projects. Happy coding!
